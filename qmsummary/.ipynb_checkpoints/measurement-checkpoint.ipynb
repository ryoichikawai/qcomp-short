What quantum mechanics can tell us is a _probability_ of finding a particular value.  That means that the outcome of  measurement is randomly chosen according to the probability.  Only in special cases, we can get the same value from the all copies,  which we can predict from the state vector.  \n",

When the measurement picked an eigenvalue of the observable, the state jumps to the corresponding eigenvector. This jump cannot be described by the current theory of quantum mechanics.  _Decoherence_ may explain a part of this process but the detail remains unclear. \n",

    "In addition to the stochastic nature of quantum measurement, there is another notable difference between classical and quantum measurements.  In classical mechanics,  we can determine the precise values of two or more physical quantities simultaneously by measurement. That may not be possible in quantum mechanics depending on what you measures.  For example, the position and momentum of a classical particle can be precisely determined. In quatum mechanics, on the other hand, if both quantities are measured from many identical copies, it is impossible to have the same outcome from the all copies.  If all copies have the same position, then every copy has very different value of momentum.  In typical cases, each copy results in a pair of different values from other copies, hence there are uncertainties in both quantities.\n",

    "The interpretation of quantum measurement is very counter intuitive. We still don’t know  how quantum measurement takes place.  Many physicists are not fully convinced by the current theory of quantum mechanics and believe that the theory of quantum mechanics is still incomplete.   There are other interpretation of quantum mechanics such as the pilot wave theory. However, all experimental results agree with the probabilities computed from the state vector.  Therefore, we adopt the standard theory of quantum mechanics in this book.  \n",

    "Finding the state of a system is not necessarily the final goal of physics.  We want to know the  values of other quantities such as  energy  In classical mechanics, physical quantities are naturally defined as number and the measurement of a physical quantity produces a unique value.  On contrary to our intuition, physical quantities in quantum mechanics are not number.  They are _self-adjoint operator_ in the Hilbert space.  The outcome of a measurement is one of the _eigenvalues_ of the operator and we don’t know which one will be the result of the measurement.  This strange behaviors are the next topics."
